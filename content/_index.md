I'm an Associate Researcher at [Observatório
Nacional](https://www.gov.br/observatorio/pt-br) (ON, Brasil).  
Before joining ON (in 2025), I was a postdoc at the Steward
Observatory (University of Arizona, US), at the University of Michigan
(US), at the University of Central Lancashire (UK), and at
Universidade de São Paulo (USP, Brasil). I earned my PhD at USP,
during which I spent a year working at the Institut d'Astrophysique
de Paris (France). I also completed my undergraduate degree at USP.

My focus is on galactic dynamics and the structure and evolution of
galaxies, at the interface of theoretical modelling, N-body
simulations, and observational data.

Topics I have investigated include collisionless relaxation processes
of gravitational systems, the role of massive clumps in the early
evolution of disk galaxies, the Milky Way’s merger history, galactic
seismology, and the orbital support and evolution of galactic bars.

My current interests center on the properties of the Milky Way's dark
matter halo, the role of resonances in shaping stellar populations in
the Galaxy, and the merger history of Andromeda.

I currently serve as co-chair of the [DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/)
Milky Way Survey working group - check the [DESI-MWS DR1 stellar
catalogs](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/dr1/#milky-way-survey-mws),
with radial velocities, chemical abundances, atmospheric parameters,
distances etc.
