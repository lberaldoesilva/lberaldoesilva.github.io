### [Minimum-entropy constraints on galactic potentials](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240707947B/abstract),

  by Beraldo e Silva et al. (2025), where we use the coordinates of a
  stellar sample in equilibrium within a given potential to constrain
  that potential, but without explicitly modelling the sample's
  distribution function. This is achieved by minimizing the entropy
  the sample would reach if it were allowed to phase-mix in trial
  potentials, since phase-mixing would increase the sample's
  entropy. In particular, using $10^4$ tracers with 10%-uncertainties
  in their 6D coordinates, we recover the flattening parameter $q$ of
  an axisymmetric potential with $\sigma_q/q\sim 5$%.  <div

  by Beraldo e Silva et al. (2023), where we show the role of
  resonances in shaping features in galactic bars, in the transition
  between their flat parts (shoulders) and box-peanut bulges. The
  looped orbital morphology that supports the shoulders is more
  markedly produced along the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR), in the
  region of orbit 2 marked in the plot. With the bar getting thicker
  over time, these orbits move to the left in this plot, until they
  cross the vertical ILR (vILR), become chaotic, more spheroidal, less
  shoulder-supporting and more bulge-supporting.

  thin disc in the Milky Way, and show that a large population of old
  stars produce three peaks in the distribution of pericentric

  produced by radial migration of thin and thick disc stars. <div

  chemo-spatial trends that agree in detail with those of the Milky
  Way. In particular, clumps provide a viable scenario for the
  formation of the thick disc. <div style="clear: both;"></div>

### [The Discreteness-driven Relaxation of Collisionless Gravitating Systems: Entropy Evolution and the Nyquist-Shannon Theorem](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872...20B/abstract),

<!-- Margins: TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT -->
<figure style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 15px;"> <img
  src="/figs/2019b_BeS_fig1.png" width="500" alt=""> </figure>
  
  by Beraldo e Silva et al. (2019), where we show that the
  collisionless relexation time $\propto N^{1/6}$ (see below) is a
  consequence of the Nyquist-Shannon theorem for a 6D phase-space. A
  finite-$N$ system can develop fine phase-space structures up to a
  certain limit, but not indefinitely small as implied by the
  assumption $N\rightarrow \infty$ in the Vlasov equation.

### [The Discreteness-driven Relaxation of Collisionless Gravitating Systems: Entropy Evolution in External Potentials, N-dependence, and the Role of Chaos](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870..128B/abstract),

  macroscopic evolution of orbit ensembles in integrable and
  non-integrable potentials. In contrast to Vlasov eq.'s prediction,
  the entropy increases quickly, even in integrable
  potentials. Chaotic motion accelerates the evolution. The
  collisionless relaxation time is $\propto N^{1/6}$ or shorter.

  macroscopic evolution of self-gravitating systems with entropy
  estimators in N-body simulations of different numbers of
  particles. In contrast to Vlasov eq.'s prediction, the entropy
  increases quickly. The N-dependence is weak.

### [Statistical mechanics of self-gravitating systems: Mixing as a criterion for indistinguishability](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PhRvD..90l3004B/abstract),

<!-- Margins: TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT -->
<figure style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;"> <img
  src="/figs/2014_BeS_fig4.png" width="550" alt=""> </figure>
  
  by Beraldo e Silva et al. (2014), where we associate the mixing
  level of particles in phase-space to their
  indistinguishability. This solves the Gibbs paradox without
  resorting to QM, predicts a more flexible distribution function
  (plot) and reveals a hidden hypothesis in the derivation of the
  Vlasov eq. (indistinguishable instead of identical particles).

### [Testing phenomenological and theoretical models of dark matter density profiles with galaxy clusters](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.436.2616B/abstract),

  src="/figs/2013_BeS_fig6.png" width="540" alt=""> </figure>
  
  by Beraldo e Silva et al. (2013), where we show the importance of
  large-scale (cosmological) contributions in the density profiles of
  galaxy clusters. With these contributions, the NFW profile
  overpredicts the density in the outskirts, while steeper profiles
  like BMO, Einasto and DARKexp provide better fits.  <div
